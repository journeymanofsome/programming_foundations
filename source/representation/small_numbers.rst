The Representation of Small Numbers
-----------------------------------

Consider the number five. There is a difference between the word "five" and the concept of the number five.

The word "five" is just a collection of symbols that convey (to speakers of English) the concept of the number five. We could also represent five with five dots: "·····". A single symbol that can also convey this is "5". There are other representations that could be used as well: "Ⅴ" in Roman numerals; "Π" in Ancient Greek; "五" in Kanji; and so on. All of these representations differ in their form but they are all ways of writing the number five.

The important concept to understand is that there is a difference between the representation (the symbol or symbols we might write down on paper) and the number that it actually represents.
