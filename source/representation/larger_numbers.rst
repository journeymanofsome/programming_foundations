The Representation of Larger Numbers
------------------------------------

We can represent a number like five with five dots: "·····" but that approach quickly becomes impractical when dealing with larger numbers and so we typically use multiple symbols to convey larger numbers.

In Roman numerals, the number six is represented as "ⅤⅠ". Note that this is not a new symbol, but the symbol for five followed by the symbol for one. However, Roman numerals aren't as simple as just adding together the individual meaning of the symbols. The Roman numeral "ⅠⅩ" does not mean one plus ten but one less than ten, in other words: nine. The order of the symbols matters.

Similarly the number "37" is not "3" plus "7" but rather follows a different convention where it indicates 3 tens plus 7 ones.

With our ten symbols---"0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" and "9"---we can represent arbitrarily large numbers.

We don't need a million different symbols, or the same symbol a million times to be able to represent the numbers up to one million. Instead, we can just write "1", "2", ..., "10", "11", ..., "999998", "999999", "1000000".

Note that there is nothing particular special about our choice of symbols or the fact there are ten of them. We could just have a single symbol---a dot, say---but that gets inefficient very quickly. There are, however, many other alternatives than picking ten symbols to construct our representations of numbers from. We could represent numbers with some combination of twenty symbols, or six symbols, or, as we shall soon see, two symbols.

The important concept to understand is that a small set of symbols can be used to represent many many more numbers.
